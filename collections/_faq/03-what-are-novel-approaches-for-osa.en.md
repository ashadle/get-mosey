An emerging approach is the application of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4242689/">cannabinoids</a> to increase upper airway tone. Here's a study on the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5665514/">role of cannabinoids on esophageal function</a>.

Person with sleep apnea isn’t the only one waking up. When the apnea is accompanied by loud snorts and snoring, the bed partner may wake up as often during the night as the person with the actual sleep disorder. One study from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10918859?ordinalpos=2&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum">Mayo Clinic</a> in Rochester, Minn., found that spouses of snorers woke up, at least partially, an average of 21 times an hour, nearly as often as the 27 times the snorers were awakened by their sleep apnea episodes.

While I am undoubtedly in the minority, I believe there must be other mates out there who somehow block out partners’ snoring, source <a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/11/sleeping-with-a-snorer/">NYT</a>
