What will impede the industry growth?
-------------

According to <a target="blank_" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/06/28/1530807/0/en/Therapeutic-Respiratory-Devices-Market-worth-over-21-5-billion-by-2024-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html">Global Market Insights</a>, innovation in therapeutic respiratory devices leading to development of easy to use, smart and high efficiency respiratory devices will drive the market growth over the forecast period. For instance, ResMed developed AirMini CPAP device, the smallest portable CPAP device that offers effective waterless humidification for portable convenience and can be controlled with the AirMini app. Adoption of such devices for treatment of various respiratory devices is increasing globally thereby accelerating the industry growth during the forthcoming years.

However, lack of patient adherence to the treatment will impede the industry growth during the forecast period. Difficulty experienced during use of respiratory devices, especially in the geriatric patients owing to physical limitations could restrict the use of these devices. Moreover, high cost burden of respiratory devices will impact the market growth to a certain extent.
