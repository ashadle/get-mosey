Main difference between Chia and Bitcoin?
-----------------------------------------

Chia is farmed with storage space like hard drives instead of mining with processing power. This allows broader access to everyday users, and vastly reduces the cost/waste of securing the network in electricity burned or custom hardware consumed. Chia is resistant to farmer centralization. Chia also will include a bunch of basic improvements to the bitcoin protocol: Everything is BLS signatures for better smart transaction support, and it will include a bunch of bug fixes to things like timewarp while making those fixes available back to Bitcoin. The goal is to make hard forks effectively impossible, so governance will come from user choice and bitcoin-like decentralized incentives.
