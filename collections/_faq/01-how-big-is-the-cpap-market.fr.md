How big is the CPAP devices market?
-------------

CPAP devices comprise a $4.3 billion market that’s growing 7.2% a year. <a target="blank_" href="http://www.sleepreviewmag.com/2018/05/cpap-devices-market-12-penetrated-says-market-research-publisher/">Marketdata</a> says the CPAP devices market is largely untapped (only 12% penetrated). It has major potential, as more people, especially the obese, are diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea.

Marketdata research director John LaRosa says in a release, “An estimated 43 million Americans suffer from obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), mostly undiagnosed. As obesity rates remain high, this problem is not likely to dissipate any time soon. Therefore, there is ample room for future growth of CPAP devices, sleep studies, OTC and prescription medications, and other services.”
