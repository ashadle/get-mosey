What does farming mean?
-----------------------

Chia farming is a bit like mining in that it’s how blocks are securely created. Farming works by carrying out a snapshot (seeding) of the unused storage available on your hard drive(s). Based on the storage a farmer farms as a percentage of all farmed storage on the network you should receive lottery type payouts for the amount of storage you are willing to allocate to farm Chia. The more unused space you allocate to farming the more likely you are to win. There will be little incentive to buy hard drives to farm Chia, as Chia expects that there is a very large amount of idle space sitting around at the moment not incrementally costing owners anything. Chia utilizes this idle space. As there is so much storage existing in the world the chance of winning a reward is extremely low for the average user, but considering it uses insignificant energy, bandwidth and the space is idle anyway, it’s not a big deal if your reward is small and infrequent. Pools, miners, ASICs and burning wasted energy are not Chia.
