* First, PillPack’s core consumer is a patient with a chronic condition. Unsurprisingly, drugs by mail make a lot of sense: the need is continuous, and predictable.
* Amazon, particularly for Prime customers, is seeking to be the retailer of habit. That is, just as a chronic condition patient may need to order drugs every month.

Sleep Apnea is a chronic condition, but adherence among OSA subjects can be as low as 50% in certain populations. Other treatment options for OSA include improving CPAP tolerability, increasing CPAP adherence through patient interventions, weight loss/exercise, positional therapy, nasal expiratory positive airway pressure, oral pressure therapy, oral appliances, surgery, hypoglossal nerve stimulation, drug treatment, and combining 2 or more of the aforementioned treatments. Despite the many options available to treat OSA, none of them are as efficacious as CPAP.

The goal may not be to fix sleep apnea: but improve something along a customer's journey to getting a CPAP machine.
