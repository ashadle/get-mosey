Why should I invest in Chia?
----------------------------

Aside from the electricity savings and less centralization of mining, Chia has many improvements over other digital money:
* Better support for simplified payment verification and mobile wallets
* Better support for Lightning Network
* BLS signatures, which allow for smaller blocks and better smart contracts with signature aggregation
* Improved transaction format, which will be safer against reorgs
* Improvement to scripting language with taproot and graftroot
* A less conservative outlook than Bitcoin, which will allow for faster upgrades
